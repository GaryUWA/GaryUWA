# Hi, I'm Zain 👋

**Recently Naturalised Australian Citizen | Data Science Graduate (UWA)** *Focusing on End-to-End ML Pipelines, Geospatial Analytics, and Automated Workflows.*

I am a Data Science graduate interested in bridging the gap between raw research and production-ready applications. My projects focus on Western Australian datasets, leveraging tools like Docker, Flask, and Streamlit to make complex models accessible.
